<h1>Hi there! I'm John Abdou!</h1>

<h2>I'm a software engineer with experience in front-end web development using JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and React.js and in back-end development using Express.js and Node.js and in relational database management using Knex.js with SQLite. I have worked for 8 years in various chemistry roles from an analytical chemist characterizing the sugar content in food and beverage ingredients to a research scientist studying chemical sensors at NASA. Throughout my career, I greatly enjoy solving problems. However, I found myself drawn to coding when I applied my knowledge of Python in script projects at work. My enjoyment in programming to solve problems encouraged me to make a career change into web development by studying Full-Stack Web Development at BloomTech.<h2>
